		address?<br />
<br />
Report should be 1-2 pages single space.<br />
Presentation should be about 10 minutes + questions at the end. <br />

#### Final Project checkpoint
Students will submit a short report on their final project outline and describe the project status/progress. (Graded Pass/Fail) This checkpoint is due **10/17**.

#### Lab 2: 
Presentation due date: **11/7 (4pm)**. <br />
Report due date: **11/13 (11:59 PM)**. <br />

Presentation and Lab Reports are submitted in groups of 2. Presentations should cover the same points as the report ( like for Lab 1).

 2. The objective of this assignment is to focus on  a specific cancer type and compare how regular,lay press ( New York Times,USA Today, Wall Street Journals another newspapers or journals) cover the same cancer topic covered or explained in medical journals ( NEJM, JAMA etc..). 

<br \>
**( This is not  a cancer topic, it is just to help you understand how to relate the lay press and the medical journal articles)**
I found an article on NEJM about a study detailing the relationship between glucose and dementia. I also found an article on NYT that discussed the same study.
Here are the links: <br />
- http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1215740 <br />
- http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/high-blood-sugar-linked-to-dementia/?_r=0 <br />

In the report please cover the following points:<br />
- Introduce the cancer you chose ( what type of cancer is it, does it have any subtypes, add general introductory information about the cancer)<br />
- Introduce/Summarize the topic related to the cancer that is discussed in the lay press and the medical journal article<br />
- What are some misconceptions and ambiguities found in the lay press article compared to the medical articles?<br />
- What should have been included, if anything, in the lay press article so that it closely matched the description of the same article in the medical journal?<br />
- If your articles contain quantitive data, please explain  them in your report and also include whether the lay press did include the same data or not.<br />



#### Lab 3: 
ECG in-class demo and data collection on 11/21. Students will submit a report on their ECG analysis.(No presentation)
Report and data analysis will be due  on 11/28.

###Lab Guideline: <br />
Using the ecg data that was emailed to you, do the following: <br />
1)plot ECG signal to show: P,QRS,T wave
2)calculate average heart rate(hint calculate RR interval)
3) calculate coefficient of variation ( hint calculate  heart standard devation and average heart rate)
4) plot heart rate (HR) over time.

#### Final Project presentation: 
In class presentations on 11/28
