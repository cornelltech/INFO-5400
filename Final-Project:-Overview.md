The final project is the most important assignment in IS5400. It must be done in pairs unless a different size group is approved by Professor Shoham. You are responsible for pairing up with another student and for finding a final project, but we will provide considerable assistance with topic selection.

Logistically, here is the schedule. 
* October 17: Checkpoint : select a final project and report preliminary progress
* November 28: Final projects due, student presentations in class.

The choice of final project is up to you, but here are some constraints and suggestions. The final project must relate to course material. This means it must involve knowledge that you did not have before taking the course. Note that it is fine to have a project that centers on material covered late in the semester, we will make informal arrangements to provide you with access to the relevant physician expertise. Depending on student interest and time constraints we may run another such informal meeting. We are also creating a Wiki page with various project ideas, including a contact physician.
