## IS 5400, Medical Literacy, Fall 2016

Welcome to the IS5400-Fall2016! This is for "Medical Literacy", taught in Fall 2016 at Cornell Tech.

All Cornell Tech masters students are welcome to enroll. In particular, students interested in possible projects with Weill Cornell, including workstudy opportunities, are strongly encouraged to attend.

This course will cover common medical terminology, an overview of anatomy and pathology, and an in-depth treatment of a few common diseases and some of the most important classes of medications. Lectures will be given by physicians from Weill Cornell's Department of Radiology. No background in biology, chemistry or medicine is assumed.
